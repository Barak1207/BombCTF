A working DHCP server is required!


Please don't shake/hit/anything violent, treat it like a real bomb...please.
If you're sure you're right, and something isn't working.
ssh to the raspberry pi
username: pi
password: rapsberry
and restart it, sudo init 6.

When you're finished, please shut it down properly. 
sudo init 0
and then disconnect it from the power.

If you wish to turn in back on again, just plug it in.
