Bomb Defusing Capture the Flag challenge 

I made this "cyber" challenge for a course during my BSc.
This requries a physical briefcase, set a speakers, LCD screen, and more. eventually it looks like a bomb.
I had problems with the standard Raspberry Pi LCD library so I had to edit it so it will work with multi threaded access to the LCD's memory.
